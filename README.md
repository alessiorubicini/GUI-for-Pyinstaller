# GUI-for-Pyinstaller
Software that provides an interface to the Pyinstaller python module

Hi guys!

I developed this software which provides an interface to the Python Pyinstaller module, 
used to convert .py files into executables.

This version is built with the MVC Pattern.
Actually is not a real MVC because I wrote the model my way but I think I did a good job.
To run the program you just have to execute the model.py file.

The software works perfectly but the GUI is not very beautiful, I'll improve it in the next versions.

Hope the software is gonna be useful.
